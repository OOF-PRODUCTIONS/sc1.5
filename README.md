Currently private rn but the stuff below is just incase we release source code.









!!DO NOT REPUBLISH THE SOURCE CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION!!

This is the Strident Crisis Source Code for people that want to make their own mods with some of the mechanics.
Note: some of the stuff was really hardcoded so yeah idk what i can do about that. also some files or .hx files are unused so they might be broken or something.


Also the CharacterSelectionState.hx is NOT from Dave and Bambi Source Code. I read the note in the source code so I didn't use it and made my own character selection state file.

alright bye and dont post the source code somewhere else.
